# Series backlog API

> API built with Go, using a Chi router and SQLite database to store data.

This API allows for managing a backlog of TV series. It provides a series of endpoints to create, read, update and delete series information. It also contains a list of endpoints to partially update a series: increment the last watched episode, change the status, increment and decrement its rank.
